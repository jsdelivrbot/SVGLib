 * TODO: add an example here
 * FACT: 1. if you use userSpaceOnUse and % values from 0 to 100% then the svg-view box is used to calculate the position of the start and end gradient points. multiply width and height with 0 to 1 to represent 0% to 100% values
 * FACT: 2. if you use userSpaceOnUse and non-percentage values then the gradient points are set in the coordinatespce of the viewBox (aboslute values)
 * FACT: 3. if you use objectBoundingBox and % values from 0 to 100% then the boundingbox of the path is used to calculate the postion of the gradient start and end. multiply with and height with 0 to 1 to represent 0% to 100% values
 * FACT: 4. if you use objectBoundingBox and non-percentage values then the points are set in the coordinatespace of the boundingBox of the path (aboslute values)
 * FACT: gradientUnits="'userSpaceOnUse' or 'objectBoundingBox'. Use the view box or object to determine relative position of vector points. (Default 'objectBoundingBox')"
 * FACT: gradientTransform="the transformation to apply to the gradient"
 * FACT: x1="the x start point of the gradient vector (number or % - 0% is default)"
 * FACT: y1="the y start point of the gradient vector. (0% default)"
 * FACT: x2="the x end point of the gradient vector. (100% default)"
 * FACT: y2="the y end point of the gradient vector. (0% default)"
 * NOTE: there is also preserveAspectRatio in the SVG specs
 * NOTE: The opacity of the color of this stop-point. If opacity changes from one stop-point with 1 to another stop-point with opacity 0, then the color will gradually become more and more transparent.
